Software: 
WE CREATED A SOFTWARE APPLICATION TO THE PROBLEM STATEMENT BUT WHILE COMMITING TO THE GITHUB WE ARE FACING A ISSUE OF MAIN FILE  “ NODE_MODULES” .WE WILL DEMONSTRATE IT
IN OUR LOCAL HOST DURING THE 2 ND ROUND.  FOR NOW WE ARE ADDING SCREENSHOTS ABOUT THE INTERFACE OF THE SOFTWARE.                                                                                                                                                                                                web page :WE CREATED WEB PAGE USING FLASK WITH 
PYTHON FOR BACKEND  BUT BY USING ONLY GITHUB WE CANNOT PROVIDE INTERFACE TO IT FOR VIEWING PURPOSE FOR THAT RESAON WE ARE ADDING SCREENSHOTS OF IT AND WE WILL DEMONSTRATE IT IN THE NEXT LEVEL.
